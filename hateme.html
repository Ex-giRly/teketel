    <h1>Our favourite girl group Katseye 🩷🧡💚💙💛💜</h1>
    <p>KATSEYE is a groundbreaking global girl group formed through *The Debut: Dream Academy*, a joint project by HYBE and
    Geffen Records aimed at creating a truly international pop act. Consisting of six members—Sophia, Lara, Manon, Daniela,
    Megan, and Yoonchae—the group represents a mix of cultures and backgrounds, with members hailing from Asia, Europe, and
    the Americas.<br> Their debut EP, *SIS (Soft Is Strong)*, released in August 2024, introduced a bold sound blending K-pop
    polish with Western pop influences.<br> With follow-up hits like “Gnarly” and “Gabriela,” and a Netflix documentary series
    chronicling their rise, KATSEYE is carving out a unique space in the global music scene, celebrated not just for their
    talent and visuals but for their message of empowerment and diversity.
